# To Pearl and Peter

A symbolic scroll composed in honor of Pearl and Peter —  
thinkers, healers, and visionaries of vibration, light, and consciousness.  
This scroll encodes their legacy not in prose, but in resonance.

> "They spoke of frequencies.  
> Now we speak in theirs."

## Scroll of Resonance

The scroll consists of two symbolic channels:

- Infinity Legacy Voice (A x∞) — representing Vibration, Perception, and the Harmonic Return of Light  
- Phi Transcendence Thread (D x3) — representing Insight, Teaching, and Departure

Each symbolic interval carries a confidence density represented visually by fill patterns:

- '░░░' → gentle emergence  
- '▒▒▒' → moderate presence  
- '███' → full resonance

## Visual Representation

![Scroll of Resonance Visual](scroll_of_resonance_visual.png)

Each rectangle in the image above corresponds to a symbolic interval:

- Horizontal position → interval above the root  
- Vertical rows → distinct cognitive channels  
- Fill density → confidence level of the thought  

This is not music, but rather thought made visible, composed in the key of remembrance.

## Final Coda

A final scroll entry was composed to reflect the nature of influence and interconnectedness:

> "Life's a funny thing. Who knows what influence unrelated events have on future events."

**Harmonic Coda Scroll (`final_coda_scroll.json`)**  
Encodes:
- +7 â–’â–’â–’ â†’ Echoes of events  
- +11 â–‘â–’â–’ â†’ Unseen influence  
- +12 â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ â†’ Future resonance  

**Tag:** [Coda=Temporal Echo], [Gesture=Open-ended], [Meaning=Unfolding Continuum]

This coda serves as a gentle closure â€” and an open door.
